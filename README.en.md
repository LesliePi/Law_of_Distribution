# The Laws of Distribution (El Leo Pa Dun, 2025)

A significant part of the world’s crises can be traced back to a failure in distribution. It is not the lack of resources, but the way they are distributed that matters. This essay seeks to explore the laws of distribution and approach universal problems from a new perspective: climate, economy, attention, love, time, knowledge – all are matters of distribution.

The “system” here refers not only to economic or social structures, but to any living or abstract system in which energy, information, attention, or value circulates. Stability does not come from the absolute quantity, but from how that quantity is distributed. A system begins to disintegrate when the balance of distribution is disrupted.

This work is not a scientific publication, but a conceptual call. A moment marking the birth of a new model. Not every statement is proven, but all can be challenged...
